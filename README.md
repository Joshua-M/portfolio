## Featured Projects

### Ad Performance Prediction & Optimisation (Deep Learning)
- Built a **deep learning model** to predict advertisement performance based on historical engagement and audience data.
- Used **CNNs** for image-based ads and **LSTMs** for sequential data to enhance click-through rate (CTR) predictions.
- Implemented **reinforcement learning** for real-time **budget allocation & bid optimisation** in programmatic advertising.
- Achieved **higher ad spend efficiency**, improved CTR accuracy, and optimised creative elements dynamically.

### Fuzzy Matching Algorithm for Data Cleaning
- Developed a **Python-based fuzzy matching script** to deduplicate advertising datasets.
- Utilised `fuzzywuzzy` and `pandas` to enhance **data accuracy and consistency**.
- Streamlined **data processing** across multiple campaigns, improving efficiency.

### Customer Conversion Prediction (Machine Learning)  
- Designed a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict **customer conversion rates** based on demographic, behavioural, and ad interaction data.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualised **feature importance** for conversion drivers.  
- Applied **one-hot encoding & standardisation** for better predictive performance.  
- Achieved **high accuracy & AUC-ROC scores**, identifying key factors influencing **customer conversion**.
- Provided insights into **ad channel effectiveness & user engagement** for campaign optimisation.

### Media Mix Modelling (MMM) – Ad Spend Optimisation
- Built a **Media Mix Model (MMM)** in Python to **analyse media channel impact on total investment**.
- Applied **Adstock Transformation, Diminishing Returns, and OLS Regression** to quantify media effectiveness.
- Simulated **budget allocation scenarios**, achieving **90.6% accuracy (R² = 0.906)** in media effectiveness predictions.

#### Key Features:
- **Predictive Modelling** – Understand how different media investments drive total spend.
- **Budget Optimisation** – Simulate ad spend strategies for **maximum ROI**.
- **Data Visualisation** – Compare **actual vs. predicted investment trends**.

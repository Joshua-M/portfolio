### 🚀 | Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Advertising Analytics | Python | Qlik Sense | Statistics | Applied Mathematics |

I'm a Data Analyst with a strong background in advertising analytics, media performance modelling, and optimisation. I build data-driven solutions to enhance decision-making across marketing and business intelligence. My expertise includes predictive modelling, data engineering, and visualisation.

## 📂 Featured Projects

###🔥 **Ad Performance Prediction and Optimisation Using Deep Learning**

- Developed a deep learning model to predict advertisement performance based on historical engagement and audience data.
- Used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based ads and LSTMs for sequential data to identify key factors influencing click-through rates (CTR), conversions, and engagement.
- Implemented reinforcement learning techniques for real-time budget allocation and bid optimisation in programmatic advertising.
- Achieved improved ad spend efficiency, increased CTR accuracy, and optimised creative elements dynamically.


### 🔍 Fuzzy Matching Algorithm for Data Cleaning
- Engineered a Python-based fuzzy matching script to deduplicate advertising datasets.
- Used `fuzzywuzzy` and `pandas` to improve data accuracy and consistency.
- Helped streamline data processing across multiple campaigns.

### 🚀 | Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Advertising Analytics | Python | Qlik Sense | Statistics | Applied Mathematics

I'm a Data Analyst with a strong background in advertising analytics, media performance modelling, and optimisation. I build data-driven solutions to enhance decision-making across marketing and business intelligence. My expertise includes predictive modelling, data engineering, and visualisation.

## 📂 Featured Projects

🔥 **Ad Performance Prediction and Optimisation Using Deep Learning**

- Developed a deep learning model to predict advertisement performance based on historical engagement and audience data.
- Used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based ads and LSTMs for sequential data to identify key factors influencing click-through rates (CTR), conversions, and engagement.
- Implemented reinforcement learning techniques for real-time budget allocation and bid optimisation in programmatic advertising.
- Achieved improved ad spend efficiency, increased CTR accuracy, and optimised creative elements dynamically.


### 🔍 Fuzzy Matching Algorithm for Data Cleaning

- Engineered a Python-based fuzzy matching script to deduplicate advertising datasets.
- Used `fuzzywuzzy` and `pandas` to improve data accuracy and consistency.
- Helped streamline data processing across multiple campaigns.

### 🎯 **Customer Conversion Prediction Using Machine Learning**  
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict **customer conversion rates** based on demographic, behavioural, and ad interaction data.  
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, including visualising **conversion distributions and feature importance**.  
- Preprocessed data with **one-hot encoding for categorical variables** and **standardisation for numerical features**.  
- Achieved **high accuracy and AUC-ROC scores**, identifying key factors influencing **customer conversions**.  
- Provided insights into **ad channel effectiveness, user engagement, and conversion likelihood** to optimise marketing strategies.

### Media Mix Model (MMM) – Optimizing Ad Spend with Data Science
- A data-driven Media Mix Model (MMM) built with Python to analyze the impact of various media channels on total investment. This project applies Adstock Transformation, Diminishing Returns, and OLS Regression to quantify media effectiveness and simulate budget allocation scenarios. The model achieves 90.6% accuracy (R² = 0.906) and provides insights to optimize media spend.

📊 Key Features:
- ✅ Predictive Modeling – Understand how different media investments drive total spend.
- ✅ Budget Optimization – Simulate different ad spend strategies for maximum ROI.
- ✅ Data Visualization – Compare actual vs. predicted investment trends.
